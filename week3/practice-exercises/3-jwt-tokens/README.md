# JWT Token Experiments

This project demonstrates how to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication in Node.js applications. JWT is a robust and secure way to handle user authentication and data exchange, making your applications safer against common attacks like token tampering.

## What is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## Setup

To get started, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. Then, install the `jsonwebtoken` library by running the following command:

```sh
npm install jsonwebtoken
```

# Conclusion
Using JWT for authentication provides a robust and secure method for handling user sessions and transmitting information between parties in a stateless manner. JWTs are compact, URL-safe, and can be signed and encrypted to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the information they carry. By following these steps, you can implement JWT authentication in your Node.js applications, enhancing security and simplifying session management.
